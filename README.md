# AlgoVisLang
this is supposed to be a simple language that you can use to visualise or teach algorithms


## design goals
- syntax similar to pseudo code, or at least easy to write
- visualize the data in a clear way
- undo lines of code, and be able to run another line


## language details
single-pass (we could implement some weird promise like structure tho to avoid the main downside of this)

this could be a transcompiler because its easier, or be our own frankenstein thing 


## sources and similar projects
getting carried by [this book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html)

similar to [this other project](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/), tho this project has a few other design goals
